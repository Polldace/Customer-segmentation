# Customer-segmentation
I did this project to gain hands-on experience in customers segmentation, RFM analysis and K-Means clustering.  

Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics so companies can market to each group effectively and appropriately.
Segmentation helps a company:
* Create and communicate targeted marketing messages that will resonate with specific groups of customers, but not with others (who will receive messages tailored to their needs and interests, instead).
* Select the best communication channel for the segment, which might be email, social media posts, radio advertising, or another approach, depending on the segment. 
* Identify ways to improve products or new product or service opportunities.
* Establish better customer relationships.
* Test pricing options.
* Focus on the most profitable customers.
* Improve customer service.
* Upsell and cross-sell other products and services.

The data used in this project is from an UK online retail, which contains all transactions that occurred from 01/12/2010 to 09/12/2011. I wrote two scripts, namely 'EDA.ipynb' and 'Customer segmentation.ipynb'. 'EDA' is responsible for conducting exploratory data analysis and pre-processing the data. 'Customer segmentation' is to segment the customers based on their spending recency, frequency and monetary value using RFM score and K-means++ clustering.
